Kendo UI Mobile App with Data Visualization
===========================================

This sample shows how to use Kendo UI Professional and Telerik AppBuilder to develop a hybrid mobile app with rich HTML5-based data visualization. The app provides a pie chart, a stock chart, a gauge and a QR code generator.

## Telerik AppBuilder and Kendo UI Professional

AppBuilder™ is an Integrated Cloud Environment (ICE) that eliminates the complexity associated with cross-platform mobile development. By combining the convenience of a local development environment with the power and flexibility of the cloud, AppBuilder lets you build hybrid mobile apps for multiple mobile platforms. For more information, see the [Telerik AppBuilder web page].

Kendo UI is a UI framework that provides everything you need to build sites and apps with pure JavaScript and HTML5. Kendo UI Professional is a Kendo UI suite that provides over 70 widgets and framework features to let you create apps with rich data visualization. For more information, see the [Kendo UI web page].

## Sample Overview

This sample shows you how to implement a native-looking user interface along with the unique Flat UI. The app provides a pie chart, stock chart, gauge, and a QR code generator. This sample was formerly available as the **Kendo UI DataViz** and the **Kendo UI mobile app with data visualization** templates in AppBuilder.

The sample shows how to use the following widgets of Kendo UI Professional.

* **Application**: The widget provides the necessary tools for building native-looking web based mobile applications.
* **RadialGauge**: The widget lets you quickly determine where a value lies in a range. Kendo UI draws the gauge using SVG.
* **Chart**: The widget draws high quality charts of the following types: bar, column, line, area, bullet, pie, donut, scatter, bubble, radar, and polar. Kendo UI draws the chart using SVG.
* **QRCode**: The widget generates canvas or SVG images that represent QR codes. Kendo UI draws the QR code using SVG.
* **StockChart**: The widgets lets you visualize stock prices and related graphs. Kendo UI draws the QR code using SVG.
